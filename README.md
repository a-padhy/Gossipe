# Gossipe - MERN Stack (Chat Application)

This project is a full-stack web application built using React for the frontend and Express.js with MongoDB for the backend. The frontend features a signup and login page, chats page that shows all recent chat history of the user. Functionality to search for other users and have one-on-one chat with them. Introduced group chat functionality, including the ability to create, edit, and manage group chats, with administrative features such as adding or removing users from groups. Incorporated persistent storage of chat messages in the database, allowing users to access their conversation history at any time.

The backend uses packages such as bcryptjs, cors, jsonwebtoken, mongoose to handle user authentication, password encryption, and database operations. It checks whether the user exists before storing the user's information in the database and uses JSON web tokens for secure communication between the client and server.
